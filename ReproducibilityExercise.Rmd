# Reproducibility

## Reproducing the Study

We are trying to reproduce the test in the study which compares the life expectancy of diabetic with non-diabetic patients. 

Here is the information given:

+---------------+------------------+-----------+
|               | Mean             |           |
| Group         | Life Expectancy  |  n        |
+===============+==================+===========+
|Non-diabetic   | 74.80            |  671      |
+---------------+------------------+-----------+
| Diabetic      | 74.64            |  44       |
+---------------+------------------+-----------+

## Exercise (4 minutes)

Now, let's try to reproduce this individually and compare answers.

1. Take 2 minutes to think about how to best simulate the data provided on two groups. Note: you should use the means and sample sizes from the table above.
2. Take 1 minute to change lines 35 and 37 with your personal simulation.
3. We will compare our p-values on PollEverywhere ([pollev.com/sta](pollev.com/sta)) and see how similar our p-values are.

```{r}
LE_nondiabetic <- sample(c(73.8,75.8), replace = TRUE, size= 671) 

LE_diabetic <- rnorm(44, 74.64, 3)
  
t.test(LE_nondiabetic, LE_diabetic)
```
